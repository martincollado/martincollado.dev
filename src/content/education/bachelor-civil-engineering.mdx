From an early age, I have been passionate about building and creating. 
I spent countless hours as a child playing with LEGO bricks, constructing houses and bridges, which fueled my interest in how structures are designed and built. 
This passion led me to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid, where I acquired a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering principles.
