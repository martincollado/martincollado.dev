From a young age, I have been passionate about technology and computers. 
Spending countless hours playing video games and exploring the internet sparked my curiosity about how computers work and how software is developed. 
This enthusiasm led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the Technical University of Madrid, where I acquired a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software engineering. 
During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on several projects at the Research Laboratory of Hydraulics and Hydrology, as well as the Harbors and Coastal Engineering department, where I developed software tools to optimize laboratory experiments.
