Used Github Actions to automate the CI/CD pipelines for multiple projects. 
Deploying to multiple environments, running tests and generating artifacts are some of the tasks that I have automated using Github Actions.
Also deployed a self-hosted runners to run the pipelines the company infrastructure.
